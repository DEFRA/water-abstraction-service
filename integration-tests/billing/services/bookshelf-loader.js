// ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜± What is going on here?
//
// So, when creating SROC charge versions we need to link to a charge category (handily called billing_charge_categories
// in the database - we know, go figure!). This is a lookup table of references that have charges linked to them. The
// table is seeded when a new environment is built and uses GUID's for ID's. This means we cannot just hardcode an ID in
// a charge element fixture like, for example, `sroc-charge-info.yaml`.
//
// We _could_ create a 'test' charge category. But as it's a fundamental part of how SROC works we didn't want to cause
// confusion down the road should a bill run (called a batch in the code and database ðŸ™„) not calculate as expected.
//
// This means we need to query the DB to get an ID. That gives us another problem. Querying a DB is an asynchronous
// operation; async/await. But `create()` down below is not an async method which means we cannot await the result of
// any async calls within it.
//
// "Just make it async" you say. Well, thanks to the way `create()` is used that becomes a problem. See
// `integration-tests/billing/services/loader.js` which does the following
//
//   # ...
//   idm: require('../services/idm-loader')(),
//   water: require('../services/bookshelf-loader')(),
//   permits: require('../services/permits-loader')(),
//   # ...
//
// It is immediately invoking `create()` and setting the return value for the property `water:`. And `water:` is part of
// an object being created on the fly and passed into ` new SetLoader()`. So, we'd have to do some major re-writing of
// how all that works just to support `create()` becoming async. ðŸ˜©
//
// So, instead we mix up async/await with some old fashioned promise callbacks. We wrap our call to the DB with the
// async method `getChargeCategories()`. It's going to return a promise when called from a non-async method. So, we use
// `then()` to add a callback to the promise. In the callback we can get the returned values and assign them to the
// loader.
//
// That brings us to what is going on here. Unlike the other loaders we declare `loader` at the top level of the module
// rather than in `create()`. We do this so both `create()` and the anonymous callback function we use in `then()` can
// access the same object. This allows us to set the charge category as a 'ref', which can be referred to in
// fixtures like `sroc-charge-info.yaml`.
//
// It isn't pretty, it is ridiculously complex, and it's all for one weird edge case. But it solves this specific
// problem without resorting to re-writing how integration-tests works.
//
