# This file contains a list of commits with mass changes for exclusion by `git blame`.
#
# Passing `--ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs` as a flag will tell git to "ignore changes made by the revision
# when assigning blame, as if the change never happened".
#
# For example:
#   git blame --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs ...
#
# You can make this the default for your local repo using:
#   git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# Doing this will allow the GitLens VS Code extension (and other tools which use the output of `git blame`) to make use
# of the file for the repo.
#
# Note that `git blame` does not use any file by default, and  the filename `.git-blame-ignore-revs` is just a
# convention.

# Use standard js for linting (#1696)
